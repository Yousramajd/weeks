        <h2><b>Infinity</b></h3>
            <p> <b>by Giacomo Leopardi</b></p>
            <p>It's always been dear to me, this isolated hill<br>
            And this hedge, that from vast parts<br>
            Of the farthest horizon excludes sight.<br>
            But sitting and gazing, interminable<br>
            Space beyond it, and superhuman<br>
            Silences, and profound quietude<br>
            In my thoughts I imagine, where almost<br>
            The heart doesn't fear. As the wind<br>
            Is heard rustling through these plants. I, that<br>
            Infinite silence to this voice<br>
            Go comparing: and I'm reminded of the eternal,<br>
            And the dead seasons, and the present<br>
            And the living, and her sound. So within this<br>
            Infinity, my thoughts drown<br>
            And sinking2 is sweet to me in this sea.</p>
